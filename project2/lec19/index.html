    <p>“I vow before Gods that I would sleep on a straw bed and eat on pattras (leaf Plate) and leave my palace to live in jungles until I bring back the glory of Chittor.” -Maharana Pratap

        On the 481st birth anniversary of the valiant king, we offer an ode to his unparalleled bravery, selfless duty towards motherland, and unshakable grit and resilience against the expansionist Mughal forces.
        
        Who was Maharana Pratap?
        
        Pratap Singh was born on May 9, 1540, in Kumbhalgarh to Rana Uday Singh ll and Rani Jeevant Kanwar. He is hailed as the hero of Rajasthan and several ballads and folklores are weaved around episodes of his heroic spirit, sacrifice, and resilience.
        
        When the brave Mewari Raja, beaming with pride used to stand against his enemies, even the mightiest of warriors used to get terrorized by just a glimpse of him. Maharana Pratap was 7 feet and 5 inches tall and carried an 80-kilogram spear and two swords, which collectively weighed 208 kilograms. The armor he used to wear weighed 72 kilograms.
        
        He belonged to the lineage of Rajput kings who were known far and wide for their valor and pride like Rana Hammir Singh, Rana Kumbha, Rana Sangha who fought until their last breath but never let down the pride and glory of their land.
        
        The brave son of the motherland:
        
        The life of Maharana Pratap is an eternal tale of inextinguishable love for one’s motherland, written with pride in the history of Rajasthan.
        
        Maharana Pratap was an ideal king who cared for his people like a father who cares for his son. A proud Rajput, he refused to submit before the Mughal forces led by Akbar even after his continuous efforts. He was the only Rajput ruler who dared to not just resist but defy the massive army of Akbar and fought until his last breath, preserving the pride and glory of his motherland.
        
        From a very tender age, Pratap Singh took a keen interest in the geopolitical and military exploits of his father against the barbaric invasions of Afghan generals.
        
        He also assisted his father Rana Uday Singh in battles, which proved the steel of the crown prince’s love for the nation and his fearless and fiercely independent spirit to the nobles.
        
        Of Maharana’s charismatic leadership and compassion:
        
        It was the Maharana’s humility, compassion, and charisma that made him so dear to everyone, from his nobles to the common people and even the often neglected tribes of Mewar. The brave king had a compassionate heart, which vowed to never attack an un-armed enemy.
        
        Pratap Singh had such devoted allies, who were ready to happily stake their everything on Maharana’s command. From Gwalior’s Ram Shah Tanwar and his three sons-Rawat Krishnadas Chundawat Ji, Maan Singh Jhala Ji, and Chandrasen Rathore Ji of Marwar to Rao Jaimal Ji, Patta, the Afghan leader Hakim Khan Sur, and a small army of people from the Bhil tribe led by Rao Poonja. The Bhil tribe was so much touched by the Maharana’s humility, that they used to call him ‘Kika’, which means son.</p>
